Initial Investigation:

- Customer records might be affected as the data was not sent from AES EDI
- Looking deeply into the issue, it showed that the file with logged customer data was sent.

Analysis:

- The next step after data sent was to check if the file was received by downstream process
- Analysing the downstream step, it showed that downstream step did not process the file on reception due to issue with 
AES CIS service (Jira Issue No: AESCIS-38263)
- Same isssue also affected EDI to CIS monitoring service working on CIS side.
- Hence the records were not discovered automatically.

- The file was resent and the issue was resolved.

The missing records were discovered at 11:56 AM and processed at 1:00 PM within the stipulated SLA.
